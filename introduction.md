## Ella Mae Loria Medrano


Hello, everyone!👋🏻 My name is Ella Mae Medrano and I am a Freshman student in Bicol University with an interest in computer science and creative projects. 👾 
<br><br>
One of my goals here is to get more comfortable using GitHub—not just for school projects, but also as a space for the little personal experiments I like starting (and hopefully finishing).
